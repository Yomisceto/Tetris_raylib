# Mini-Tetris raylib

### Introduction
Mini Tetris is a simple implementation of the classic game, built using the C++ programming language and the raylib library. 
It provides a fun and interactive way to play Tetris.

### Technologies used:
The mini tetris application is built using the following technologies and tools:
- C++ programming language for the application logic.
- raylib for graphics and user interface

### Features
- **Universal Tetromino Class:** Mini Tetris includes a versatile Tetromino class that efficiently handles the movement and rotation of any Tetromino shape. This makes it easy to add new forms and expand the variety of gameplay.
- **Grid-based Game Board:** The game board is represented as a grid of cells. Various operations such as drawing, moving, and rotation are accomplished by coloring the appropriate cells on the grid.
- **Simple Controls:** Use the arrow keys to move the Tetromino left, right, or down. Press the 'E' or 'Q' to rotate the Tetromino and "Space" to pause the game.
- **Scoring System:** Keep track of your score as you clear lines. The more lines you clear simultaneously, the higher your score will be. Aim for the highest score possible!
